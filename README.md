Hey there! ðŸ––

I'm a Self-Taught Software Developer specializing in **Shopify** and **headless commerce** solutions. With over five years of experience, I excel in building custom Shopify stores using modern technologies. 

I'm also interested in learning **Node.js** and using **Vue.js** for web projects. Passionate about ecommerce, open-source projects, Neovim, and self-hosted solutions, I continuously expand my skills in software development, computer science, and web technologies.

Open to collaboration!
