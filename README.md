Hey there! 🖖

I'm a self-taught developer with over five years of experience in the **Shopify** and ecommerce space. While I’ve spent a lot of time building stores and apps, I’m currently shifting my focus toward **Cloud Native engineering** and learning how to design more complex backends and systems architecture.

I still work daily with **TypeScript** and **Node.js**, but I’m now spending more time with microservices and infrastructure. I’m a big fan of open-source, Neovim, and self-hosting, and I’m always looking to get deeper into the technical side of how things are built.

Open to collaboration!
